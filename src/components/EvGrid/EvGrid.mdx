# Grid System

Evance UI comes with a 12-point grid system, built using flexbox.

The grid is used to create specific layouts within an applicationâ€™s content.
It contains 5 types of media breakpoints that are used for targeting specific
screen sizes or orientations: `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg` and `xl`.
