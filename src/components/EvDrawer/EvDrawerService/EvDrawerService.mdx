# EvDrawerService

Drawers can be created programmatically with any component supplied to the `EvDrawer` slots using the `EvDrawerService`.


## Installation

The `EvDrawerService` needs to be installed as an application plugin.

```ts
import {createApp} from 'vue';
import {EvDrawerService} from "@evance/amethyst/services";

// Import the root component App from a single-file component & create the App
import App from './App.vue'
const app = createApp(App);

// Load the service directly
app.use(EvDrawerService);
```

For larger applications you may wish to load all of the Evance UI services.

```ts
import {createApp} from 'vue';
import * as services from "@evance/amethyst/services";
import {createEvanceUi} from "@evance/amethyst/framework";

// Import the root component App from a single-file component & create the App
import App from './App.vue'
const app = createApp(App);

const evanceUi = createEvanceUi({
    services
});

// Load the service directly
app.use(evanceUi);
```


## Accessing the service

The service is available with the `useDrawer()` function for Composition API and the `$drawer` property of the
application for the Options API.

```ts
// Composition API
import { useDrawer} from '@evance/amethyst/composables/drawer';

const drawer = useDrawer();

// Options API
const drawer = this.$drawer;
```

## Opening an EvDrawer programmatically

The `open` function of the `EvDrawerService` is used to open an `EvDrawer` and accepts an options object which may contain:
the `props` to assign the `EvDrawer`; the `slots` to render within the drawer; and the `data` you would like to pass to the
components you supplied within the slots.

```ts
import ExampleComponent from './ExampleComponent';
import { useDrawer } from '@evance/amethyst/composables/drawer';

const drawer = useDrawer();

function show() {
    drawer.open({
        props: {
            width: 'large'
        },
        slots: {
            default: ExampleComponent
        },
        data: {
            title: 'Example #1'
        }
    });
}

```

The component can also be loaded asynchronously - useful in conditional cases or to improve load times.

```ts
import { useDrawer } from '@evance/amethyst/composables/drawer';

const drawer = useDrawer();

const dynamicComponent = defineAsyncComponent(() => import('./ExampleComponent.vue'));

function show() {
    drawer.open({
        slots: {
            default: dynamicComponent
        }
    });
}
```

## Closing a drawer instance

The `close` function is available via the `EvDrawerInstance` which is injected into your component using the
`injectDrawer()` function.

```ts
import { injectDrawer } from '@evance/amethyst/composables/drawer';

const drawerInstance = injectDrawer();

function close() {
    drawerInstance.close();
}
```

## Passing data between components

Use the `data` property of the `open()` options object to pass data to your rendered component and
the returned Promise to receive data from the drawer when it closes.

```ts

// Parent component
const drawer = userDrawer();

drawer.open({
    slots: {
        default: ExampleComponent
    },
    data: {
        id: 1,
        title: "My Example Title"
    }
}).then(response => {
    console.log(response); // { success: true }
});

```

Use the `close` function to pass data back as a response in the Promise created by the `open` function.

```ts
// ExampleComponent
import { injectDrawer } from '@evance/amethyst/composables/drawer';

const drawerInstance = injectDrawer();

const data = drawerInstance.data; // { id: 1, title: "My Example Title" }

function close() {
    drawerInstance.close({
        success: true
    });
}
```

## Example
The Example below is a recursive drawer, which can open and receive data from each successive component.

<Canvas>
    <Story of={EvDrawerServiceStories.Primary} />
</Canvas>
